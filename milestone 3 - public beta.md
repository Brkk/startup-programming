# Milestone 3 - Final Presentation (Public Beta)

We are happy to invite you to present your third milestone at ????, Friday 28/11/2014 (place and time TBD).
  
In the meeting you'll get the opportunity to present the beta version of your project and share your experience with each other (as well as additional guests and ??? developers that might be curious enough to visit).

We remind you that for this third milestone you are required to provide a fully functioning project, that will be evaluated by the course staff, and you'll get valuable feedback regarding the expected final project configuration and scope.

This is not BETA in the sense of "only a proof of concept" but rather in the sense of "you could still fix minor bugs or add minor missing features emerged at the last minute". By the third milestone you should have completed your product (except for some minor bugs which you may fix until the Final Submission). Please provide a full demonstration (**15 minutes**) of using your product in various scenarios on the *live* project. The demonstration should encompass your top features, and highlight your product complexity and challenges (architectural/algorithmic/technological/design/usability etc). You should also be prepared to talk about your development process, in case you are asked: how did you split the work? what was easy? what was difficult? why?

If you are using a power point presentation, use **no more than 5** slides altogether (including cover slide!). Please send us the presentation (and any other document that you think would be useful for us to better evaluate your work) by email beforehand.
As we may have additional guests that did not watch your previous presentations, make sure your presentation is self contained.

Please include in your presentation:

- Product overview and motivation
- High level architecture, and the technologies used
- Project challenges, including your own experience and reflections

Some general advice:

- Prepare an appealing demo!
- You have only a short time for the demonstration so start with your key features.
- If you are demonstrating social features of your gadget, or any other features that require prior preparations - please prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users). 
- It is also advised to rehearse your presentation so it will flow nicely. For example: make sure you can demonstrate different users simultaneously using different browsers.

If by this stage you've already done a pilot with real users please provide a **very short** summary explaining how you've done the pilot and what feedback you've received from the users (please send us by email the pilot summary beforehand).

You were required for Milestone 2 to provide in your project GitHub page a link to your running application (e.g. App-Engine website or a download link to an Android apk file).  
For mobile applications you are required to provide a link to a page which will include installation and usage instructions for your users. This page should have images/videos which show how to install and use your application. In addition it should have a requirements section (i.e. if your app needs android 2.2). This page needs to be simple and clear so that any user (including users which have never seen your app before) could install and use your application.

**Important note:** Full grading for the milestone (25 points) will be given for teams that are successfully:

1. Focusing on primary use case and taking into account our feedback (sent by email for every team).
2. Following the project plan while adapting dynamically.
3. Continuously working throughout the semester.
4. Demonstrating an interesting, self contained, useful, and live application.
5. Providing a link to a live application and a link to installation/usage instructions page
6. Finishing level of the existing features
7. Good presentation (simple, clear, focused, time-framed, sincere)

**Important note:** This is not the final submission of your project. Please see details on the [Final Submission](final submission.md) page.

If you have any questions or comments please do not wait for the milestone meeting, use email: [alexeyza@uvic.ca](mailto:alexeyza@uvic.ca)

Good luck,
