# Final Submission

Note that the final submission is not done as a face-to-face presentation but as deploying your final application and all supplemented material to the Web.

By the due date (3/3/2013) you should send us an email ([taugadgets@gmail.com]()) that includes:

- link to download final application installation file or to the App-Engine website
- link for all the source code involved in your final project (client, server, other)
- link to the final project documentation (architectural overview, main APIs, installation and usage instructions)
- link to a video demonstrating the application (try to show all the various features of your application and explain them in the video).

After that date, the course staff will go over your projects, test them and evaluate them, without you're being present so it is very important that everything would be self explained.

Make sure to fix issues that we gave you feedback regarding them during the last milestone, and in case you need further clarifications please write us an email ([taugadgets@gmail.com]()).
Make sure that your Google Code website is clear and informative. Make sure your application runs correctly on all browsers (or on all android devices if it's an android app).
Give special attention to usability issues, look & feel and simplicity.

**Important note:** Full grading for the Final Submission (30 points) will be determined by following criteria:

1. Interesting use case (is it useful?)
2. User experience (intuitive, self explanatory)
3. Functional complexity
4. Technical difficulty (uses various technologies and resources)
5. Finishing level (bugs, missing features)
6. Documentation (is it useful for users/developers) 

Good luck,
Peggy, Cliff, Arie, Ian and Alexey
