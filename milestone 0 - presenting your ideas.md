# Presenting Your Ideas
In the next meeting (05/11/2012) you should present your project idea.

You would be given 15 minutes for that as follows:

- On the first 5 minutes you would present the main scenario (use case) and perssonas that your application targets.
    - Describe the situation, the need and the data involved and the decisions made in the process.
    - Describe the overall architecture of the application, what functionality will be implemented in each part: client/server/mobile/external sources/etc. 
    - Estimate what could be **demonstrated** in one month, what could be demonstrated after another 2 months and what are possible extensions that could not be finished within the time frame of the semester but seems to be natural extension of your application.
    - Include in your presentation UI mock-ups.
- On the next 5 minutes you would answer questions from the rest of the class and the workshop staff.
During this discussion the workshop team  would try to estimate whether your use-case is well developed and your estimations are real.
- On the last 5 minutes you would get feedback from workshop staff.

Good example for a presentation:

**Some tips:**

- Early feedback is a good thing! It is advisable that you send us your idea as soon as possible via email ([alexeyza@uvic.com](mailto:alexeyza@uvic.com)) - this would save you a lot of time (e.g. if you took a wrong directions, impossible mission, etc.). 
- 15 minutes is a very short time!
- If you are preparing a power point presentation - **do not prepare more than 5 slides** (including cover slide).
- Be Visual: If you have already thought about user interface, you may show a sketch of it in the presentation.
- You may bring your own laptop (so no computability problems would occur during your presentation).
- Be simple and precise.
- Take a look at presentation from previous semesters (for example at the bottom of [https://sites.google.com/site/cloudweb10a/teams-and-projects](https://sites.google.com/site/cloudweb10a/teams-and-projects))
- Rehearse your presentation within the team and make sure you are all on the same page.
- Please send us your presentation before the meeting.

Good luck!
