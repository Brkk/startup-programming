#Milestone 2 - Release Candidate

For the second milestone (Monday, 31/12/2012) you are required to show progress based on the feedback you've received from the staff at Milestone 1.

Please provide a full demonstration (**6 minutes**) of using your product in various scenarios. The demonstration should encompass your top features, and **highlight** new features or changes made since Milestone 1.
You should also be prepared to talk about your development process, in case you would be asked to (what is your plan for the next Milestone? how long do you expect the work would take? how did you split the work? what was easy? what was difficult? why?).

If you are using a power point presentation, use **no more than 3 slides** altogether (including cover slide!)

Some general advice:

- Prepare an appealing demo!
- You have only a short time for the demonstration so start with your new features or changes you've made since Milestone 1.
- If you are demonstrating social features of your application, or any other features that require prior preparations - please prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users). 
- It is also advised to rehearse your presentation so it will flow nicely (For example: make sure you could demonstrate different users simultaneously - using different browsers for example)

You are required to provide in your project page (on GitHub) a link to your live application (App-Engine website or a download link to an Android apk file). In addition provide instructions on how to use your application and how to install it (if installation is needed).

**Important note:** Full grading for Milestone 2 (25 points) will be given for teams that will successfully show:

1. Focusing on primary use case and taking into account our feedback (sent by email for every team).
2. Following the project plan while adapting dynamically.
3. Continuously working along the semester.
4. Demonstrating an interesting, self contained, useful and live application.
5. Providing a link to a live application.
6. Good presentation (simple, clear, focused, time-framed, sincere)

If you have any questions or comments please do not wait for the milestone meeting, use email: [alexeyza@uvic.com](mailto:alexeyza@uvic.com)

Good luck,
